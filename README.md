# 💛 LIFELINE AI: Voice-Driven Emotional First-Aid

> A voice-based mental health assistant that listens, detects emotion, comforts, and alerts when needed.

---

## 🧠 Overview

LIFELINE AI is a **streamlit-based voice-driven emotional support system**. It uses natural language processing to recognize your emotions through voice and responds accordingly — by showing comforting memories, speaking kind words, or alerting a trusted contact in case of emotional distress.

This is just the **first step** in my vision. Future versions will integrate this into a mobile app that:
- Records calls (with permission),
- Classifies emotional state,
- Sends memory notifications,
- Sends images to email in critical cases.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Input:** Speak your thoughts — no typing needed.
- 📊 **Emotion Detection:** Uses a transformer-based NLP model to analyze your mood.
- 🗣️ **Human-like Voice Output:** Comforting responses using female text-to-speech with natural speed.
- 📸 **Memory Boost:** Displays a happy memory image when you're feeling low.
- 📧 **Emergency Email:** Sends alert to your contact when high sadness is detected.
- 🧠 **Offline Interaction:** Works without storing or uploading sensitive user data.
